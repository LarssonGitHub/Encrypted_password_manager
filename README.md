# The poor man's password vault

Create an app in node.js that can store chipered passwords, usernames for websites and services, **which must** be able
to run as a stand-alone application without the need for a browser.


### Must have:Â (A paragraph with a strikethrough means the goal has been fulfilled.)

* ~~The application must be written in TS.~~
~~* App, once compiled, must be able to run on Linux, Mac, and Windows as an executable file without the need for a web
browser.~~
* ~~All information submitted by each user must be cipred, hashed, and/or encrypted and shall only be decryptable with a
few passphrases set by the user.~~
* ~~The app itself must be hosted 100% locally, a user should be able to download it and use it right away.~~
* ~~Furthermore, all data, code, packages, modules, or databases must be in the app itself and shall not be hosted
online in any manner.~~
* ~~User should be able to edit, delete, and add new data as he sees fit.~~
* ~~Apply CSS, tables, or other styling to make the app more presentable.~~
* ~~Create custom icon for app.~~

### Tools, packages, and frameworks used as of now in the project. *(These will be added or removed as the project
grows!)*

* TS, Electron, Crypto-js with AES, Node.js

### Known bugs and needed fixes

* Once the app has been built as an executable on Windows and the user tries to start the app, their anti-virus might
flag it as dangerous.

Temporary solutions:

1. Run the executable in the unpacked folder, which doesn't seem to trigger any warnings.
2. Manually whitelist the application in the anti-virus program.
3. Run the app in a dev environment with the start script.

* Favicon doesn't seem to appear in Linux OS builds.

* Mac build needs further testing on its OS.
