# The poor man's password vault

Create an app in node.js that can store chipered passwords, usernames for websites and services, **which must** be able to run as a stand-alone application without the need for a browser.


### Must have: (A paragraph with a strikethrough means the goal has been fulfilled.)

~~* The application must be written in TS.~~
* App, once compiled, must be able to run on Linux, Mac, and Windows as an executable file without the need for a web browser.
~~* All information submitted by each user must be cipred, hashed, and/or encrypted and shall only be decryptable with a few passphrases set by the user.~~
* The app itself must be hosted 100% locally, a user should be able to download it and use it right away.
~~* Furthermore, all data, code, packages, modules, or databases must be in the app itself and shall not be hosted online in any manner. ~~
~~* User should be able to edit, delete, and add new data as he sees fit.~~
~~* Apply CSS, tables, or other styling to make the app more presentable.~~
* Create custom icon for app


### Nice to have: *(More can be added later.)*

* Use SCSS for styling. 


### Tools, packages, and frameworks used as of now in the project. *(These will be added or removed as the project grows!)*

* TS, Electron, Crypto-js with AES, Node.js
